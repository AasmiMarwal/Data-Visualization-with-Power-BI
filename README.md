4.	Inserted another visual known as key Influencers, named it Operating Profit- once done loaded data from the data sheet (Operating profit) – Explained by beverages (data from sheet).

5.	Inserted another visual known as Map to show the sales by states (US)- Added states and total sales from the data sheet- Formatted the visual (changed Bubble size, colour, added zoom buttons).

6.	Inserted Matrix visual – added data from the sheet (Beverage brand, Total sales, units sold, operating margins, Operating profit, price per unit), some of values were in sum which does not make sense in the visuals so changed the same to average which was more appropriate..
